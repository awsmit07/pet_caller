;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; kill_x_cycles(unsigned long int x)
; This function passes roughly x cycles, where x is any 32-bit integer.
; Because of the entry and exit times, it will never quite be exact, but the
; larger x is, the less impact the overhead will be.  
; The processor is fully awake during this time and simply kills instructions
; by running through a loop.  
; To be compatible with C code, the function parameter must use r0 as, by 
; convention, that's where the compiler would put it.
; All timing is shown in [ ].  The function overhead is subtracted off the value passed
; in, then the value is reduced by the number of cycles it takes for each run of the kill_x_loop
; There will be a remainder error here, but it's at most 2 cycles.
;
; Requires:
;	- R0 is an unsigned value holding the number of cycles to be passed
;
; Promises:
;	- Roughly x cycles will be passed.  At 12 MHz clock, each cycle is 83.3ns.
;   Therefore, the maximum time that can be passed is about 357 seconds.
; - r0 is destroyed during this code, thus the function is not re-entrant.
